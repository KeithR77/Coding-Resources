## Books

| Title | Author(s) | Description | Length | Price | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Pragmatic Programmer | David Thomas, Andrew Hunt | For twenty years, the lessons from The Pragmatic Programmer have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology. This classic title is regularly featured on “Top Ten” lists, and many corporations issue it to their new hires. | 320 Pages | $40.00 USD | [Link](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)
| Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship | Robert C. Martin | Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code--of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. | 431 Pages | $47.00 USD | [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
